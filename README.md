# Charter-Spectrum FE Code Challenge

### About
Depoloyed to: [Restaurant Challenge](https://restaurant-challenge.netlify.app/) using Netlify

In this challenge, I consumed an external API using Axios, and displayed restaurant results sorted alphabetically.
- Once all restaurants are displayed, users can filter restaurants by state.
- Users can search by state using upper or lower case entries, and can continue to filter and render search results by entering new abbreviations in the search bar.
- After viewing by state, Users can click the "Clear" button to reset all results.

### `Fork and Clone (to run locally)`
- Install `yarn` or `npm`
