# Charter-Spectrum FE Code Challenge

### About
Depoloyed to: [Restaurant Challenge](https://restaurant-challenge.netlify.app/) using Netlify

In this challenge, I consumed an external API using Axios, and displayed restaurant results sorted alphabetically.
Once all restaurants are displayed, users can filter restaurats by state.
After viewing by state, Users can click the "Clear" button to reset all results.
